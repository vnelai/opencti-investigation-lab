# üó∫Ô∏è MITRE ATT&CK Technique Mapping Summary

## üîç Objective
Summarize all MITRE ATT&CK techniques and kill chain phases identified during this OpenCTI investigation lab.

## üßæ Technique Overview
| Tactic              | Technique Name               | Technique ID | Associated With         | Kill Chain Phase     |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|--------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|
| Execution (ICS)     | Command-Line Interface        | T0807        | CaddyWiper              | Execution-ICS         |
| Execution           | Native API                    | (custom)     | CaddyWiper              | Execution             |
| Initial Access      | Drive-by Compromise           | T1189        | APT37                   | Initial Access        |
| Initial Access      | Phishing                      | T1566        | APT37                   | Initial Access        |
| Discovery           | File and Directory Discovery  | T1083        | APT37 / Others (mapped) | Discovery             |
| Discovery           | Process Discovery             | T1057        | APT37 / Others (mapped) | Discovery             |
| Discovery           | System Information Discovery  | T1082        | APT37 / Others (mapped) | Discovery             |
| Discovery           | Permission Groups Discovery   | T1069        | APT37 / Others (mapped) | Discovery             |

## üìà What This Shows
- Wide coverage of MITRE ATT&CK tactics: Execution, Initial Access, and Discovery
- Accurate linking of techniques to threat actors, malware, and tools
- Use of ATT&CK IDs in context of both Enterprise and ICS matrices

## üîó Sources Referenced
- OpenCTI‚Äôs embedded MITRE ATT&CK matrix and technique relationship graphs
- Entity-specific timelines and knowledge tabs throughout the lab
